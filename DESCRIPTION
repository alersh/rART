Description: Adaptive Resonance Theory is a neural network model originally developed by Stephen Grossberg. It behaves like a clustering algorithm but without the need to specify the number of clusters. Unlike the multilayer perceptrons, an ART system can continously learn new categories while retaining the old memories.
